|     1 | Something broken: application cannot load - undefined local variable or method `task_path'           |
|     2 | The job class must have a location field to hold the street address where the job is to be performed |
|     3 | User interface for task needs way to pick job                                                        |
|     4 | There should be a field in the Task that allows it to be marked as completed                         |
|     5 | There should be a field in the Task where the number of hours worked can be entered                  |
|     6 | The word "Task" is misspelled on the New Task page!                                                  |
|     7 | The Task list should include the job that the task belongs to                                        |
|     8 | A job should be able to be marked as completed                                                       |
|     9 | The job list should have completed jobs listed separately from incomplete jobs                       |
|    10 | Jobs can be created with no name!                                                                    |
